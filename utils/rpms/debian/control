Description: Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage
 An open-source software-defined object store designed from the ground up
 for massively distributed Non Volatile Memory (NVM). DAOS takes advantage
 of next generation NVM technology like Storage Class Memory (SCM) and NVM
 express (NVMe) while presenting a key-value storage interface and providing
 features such as transactional non-blocking I/O, advanced data protection
 with self healing on top of commodity hardware, end-to-end data integrity,
 fine grained data control and elastic storage to optimize performance and
 cost.
 .
 This is the package to run a DAOS client.
